## User Profile Pic ##

Step 1: In users/models.py, create a class Profile
    This class will variables displaying on Profile page of web app
    It contains user and image.
    Add str dunder method within class which will display the way we want

Step 2: We need to make migrations for the changes in model to take place
    Initally install pillow package since we are using method ImageField in class
>> pip install pillow
>> pip manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'users':
    + Create model Profile
    ** This will create new migration file to store the Profile page data in db **
>> python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, blog, contenttypes, sessions, users
Running migrations:
  Applying users.0001_initial... OK

Step 3: Register the class Profile in users/admin.py file
admin.site.register(Profile)

Step 4: run server and open the website , login to admin page
Empty Profile section will be created.
Add profile --> select User --> choose file for image --> Save
** Add one test user with default image **

Step 5: Stop server and start shell in terminal to understand various methods
(InteractiveConsole)
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> user = User.objects.filter(username='ShreyaVP').first()
>>> user
<User: ShreyaVP>
>>> user.profile 
>>> user.profile.image.width
800
>>> user.profile.image.url
'/profile_pics/linkedIn_profile_pic.jpeg'
>>> user = User.objects.filter(username='TestUser').first()
>>> user
<User: TestUser>
>>> user.profile.image
<ImageFieldFile: default.jpg>
>>> quit()

Step 6:The image is by default saved in home directory django_projects creating profile directory.
Change the location of image saved:
- in django_projects/settings.py, add new variables
 MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR ,'media')
 MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

MEDIA_ROOT will create the path in media where it will create profile dir where profile pics will be stored
MEDIA_URL will be url for profile pic on website 

Step 7: Goto profile.html and add code snippet which is bootstrap layout for profile webpage

Step 8: In django_projects/url.py, we have to add static MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

Step 9: To setup default image, place the image in media folder and rename to default.jpg
 ** verify image name and directory by right-click on test user profile pic and check its url **

Step 10: We want to avoid going to admin profile to add new user's profile, 
instead new user should already have default pic as account is created.
Thus, we create django singnal, create file users/signals.py and add the code 
** Verify after creating new user, its profile has default pfp
