Steps followed to create new application and routes

Step 1: Create new app called 'blog'. It will create new folder 'blog' creating app structure
>> python manage.py startapp blog
   ** New folder 'blog' is created **
    C:./26_python_for_web/django_project/
    │───db.sqlite3
    │───manage.py
    │
    ├───blog
    │   │---admin.py
    │   │---apps.py
    │   │---models.py
    │   │---tests.py
    │   │---views.py
    │   │---__init__.py
    │   │
    │   └───migrations
    │       └───__init__.py
    │
    ├───django_project


Step 2: Goto '/blog/views.py' and write functions 'home' and 'about' for website:
    def home(request):
        return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog Home</h1>')

    def about(request):
        return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog About</h1>')

Step 3: Mapping urls to views.functions
Create new file urls.py in blog, import views.py file and call above functions:
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.home, name='blog-home'),
        path('about/', views.about, name='blog-about'),
    ]

Step 4: Mapping blog/urls.py to django_projects/urls.py
Included blog urls to 'django_project/urls.py' using include()
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),
    ]

** This tells whole website which urls should send user to blog app **

** include() routes to given string and chops off anything before string. 
Initally, it processed blog part of url, which include() has choped of remaing with empty string.
This matches to '' in blog/urls step 3**

Step 5: Now run server, open the localhost:8000 and explore website
>> python manage.py runserver
    ** the localhost will show 404 error (Not Found) instead of default development site as it dint find the urls it tried to match: 
    - blog/
    - about/  **

Step 6: Open "localhost:8000/blog"
    ** Opens the webpage with written "Blog Home" **
    Right-click -> view page source
    ** Page displays http response **
    <h1>Blog Home</h1>

Step 7: Open "localhost:8000/blog/about"
    ** Opens about webpage with "Blog About" **

Step 8: To create homepage "blog home" on 'localhost:8000', change the code in 'django_project/urls.py' 
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),
    to
    path('', include('blog.urls')),

** string in path(str) is url, if we change it to "blog_dev" our homepage url is "localhost:8000/blog_dev" and about page to "localhost:8000/blog_dev/about" url **

Step 9: Now open "localhost:8000" 
    ** It will show page "Blog Home" **
    
Step 10: Open "localhost:8000/about"
